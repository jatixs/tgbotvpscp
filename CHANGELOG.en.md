## [1.10.12] - 2025-10-22

### What's new?

#### üöÄ Added:
* **Multilingual Support (i18n):**
    * Added full support for Russian and English languages for all bot messages, including buttons, menus, errors, and notifications.
    * Users can now select their preferred language using the new "üá∑üá∫ –Ø–∑—ã–∫" / "üá¨üáß Language" button in the main menu.
    * Language settings are saved for each user in `config/user_settings.json`.
    * Created a new module `core/i18n.py` to manage translations and language settings.
* **Updated Documentation:** Added English versions of `README.md` and `CHANGELOG.md` with links to switch between languages.

#### ‚ú® Improved:
* **Code Structure:** All user-facing text strings have been moved from the modules and core code into the central translation dictionary `core/i18n.py`, simplifying the addition of new languages and text editing.
* **Watchdog Error Handling:** Improved error handling and message output in `watchdog.py` using the i18n system (in the default language).
* **Navigation:** Minor improvements to message deletion logic and returning to the main menu in some modules (`traffic`, `vless`).

#### üîß Fixed:
* **Watchdog:** Fixed potential JSON decoding error when receiving response from Telegram API. Specified exception types for network errors. Corrected `inactive`/`failed` state detection logic.
* **i18n:** Fixed handling of non-integer `user_id` and string formatting errors. Added checks for translation key existence.

## [1.10.11] - 2025-10-21

### What's new?

#### üöÄ Added:
* **"‚ö°Ô∏è Optimize" Button:** Added a new module (`optimize.py`) to execute a set of system cleanup and optimization commands (root admins only).
* **Log Check by Watchdog:** `watchdog.py` now checks `bot.log` for errors (`ERROR`/`CRITICAL`) after the bot service starts.
* **Update Notifications:**
    * `watchdog.py` now periodically checks GitHub Releases and notifies about new versions.
    * `bot.py` now checks for updates on startup and notifies the administrator.
* **Version Display in `deploy.sh`:** The installation/update script now shows the locally installed and latest available versions from GitHub.
* **Bot Name in Watchdog:** `watchdog.py` now uses the bot name from the `TG_BOT_NAME` variable (if set in `.env`) in its notifications.

#### ‚ú® Improved:
* **Watchdog Status Logic:** Improved tracking and display of bot service statuses ("Unavailable" üî¥ -> "Starting" üü° -> "Active" üü¢ / "Active with errors" üü†).
* **Log Monitoring:** Reworked the `reliable_tail_log_monitor` function in `modules/notifications.py` for greater stability and elimination of `asyncio` errors.
* **`deploy.sh` Script:**
    * Improved detection of the target branch when run with an argument or via `bash <(wget ...)`.
    * Added clearer information about branches and versions in the menu.
* Minor changes in code formatting and message texts.

#### üîß Fixed:
* **`AssertionError: feed_data after feed_eof` Error:** Resolved an `asyncio` race condition error when reading logs (`tail -f`) in `modules/notifications.py`.
* **`NameError: name 're' is not defined` Error:** Added the missing `import re` in the `modules/optimize.py` module.
* **`unexpected EOF while looking for matching }'` Error:** Fixed bash syntax (missing parenthesis) in the `run_with_spinner` function in `deploy.sh`.
* **User Saving Error:** Corrected the user loading logic in `core/auth.py` so that added users are correctly saved to `users.json`.
* **New User Name Display:** New users are now immediately displayed with the name obtained from the Telegram API, rather than the temporary "New\_ID".

## [1.10.10] - 2025-10-20

### üí• Breaking Changes

-   **Complete Modularization:** The bot's code (`bot.py`) has been completely reorganized. Logic is divided into the core (`core/`) and function modules (`modules/`). The old structure is no longer supported.
-   **Reworked `deploy.sh`:** The installation/update script (`deploy.sh`) now uses `git clone` / `git reset` for file management and includes an installation integrity check. The old installation method via `curl` has been removed. **A clean (re)installation using the new `deploy.sh` is required.**

### üöÄ Added

-   **Integrity Check in `deploy.sh`:** The `deploy.sh` script now automatically checks for the presence of all necessary files (`core/`, `modules/`, `.git`, `venv/`, `.env`, `systemd` services) before displaying the menu.
-   **"Smart" Routing in `deploy.sh`:** Depending on the integrity check result (OK, PARTIAL, NOT_FOUND), `deploy.sh` directs the user to the appropriate menu (Installation, Management, or Error Message/Reinstallation suggestion).
-   **Automatic `.gitignore` Creation:** The `deploy.sh` script now creates a `.gitignore` file to protect user files (`.env`, `config/`, `logs/`, `venv/`) from being overwritten during updates via `git`.

### ‚ú® Improved

-   **Project Structure:** The new modular architecture (`core/`, `modules/`) significantly improves code readability, simplifies maintenance, and makes adding new features easier.
-   **Installation/Update Reliability:** Using `git` in `deploy.sh` instead of `curl` ensures all current project files are obtained and simplifies the update process.
-   **Menu Button Grouping:** Buttons in the main `ReplyKeyboard` menu are now grouped into logical categories for better navigation (although submenus were removed in favor of a single menu).

### üîß Fixed

-   **User ID Error in "Back to Menu" Callback:** Fixed an issue where pressing the inline "Back to Menu" button used the bot's ID instead of the user's ID, resulting in access denial.
-   **`NameError: name 'KeyboardButton' is not defined` Error:** Resolved a missing import of `KeyboardButton` in `bot.py`.
-   **`systemd` Service Parsing Error:** Corrected incorrect formatting of the `[Service]` section in `.service` files created by `deploy.sh` (all directives were on one line).

## [1.10.9] - 2025-10-19

### üîß Fixed (Hotfixes)

-   **Freezing on Shutdown/Restart:** Completely resolved the issue where the bot would hang for 90 seconds (`SIGTERM timeout`) when stopping the service. Implemented correct signal handling (`SIGINT`/`SIGTERM`) and shutdown sequence: stop polling, cancel background tasks (including `tail`) with timeouts, close session. Fixed `RuntimeError: Event loop is closed` and `AttributeError` during session closure.
-   **False Alert System Trigger:** The Alert system (`watchdog.py`) now correctly ignores planned restarts initiated by the bot (checks `restart_flag.txt`).
-   **Duplicate Resource Alerts:** Resource checking has been completely removed from the Alert system (`watchdog.py`) and is now performed only by the bot (`bot.py`), respecting user settings.

### üöÄ Added

-   **Log Monitoring:** The bot now monitors SSH login events (`auth.log`/`secure`) and Fail2Ban bans (`fail2ban.log`) in the background using `tail -f`.
-   **Notification Settings:**
    -   Added a "üîî Notifications" menu allowing users to enable/disable alerts for resources (CPU/RAM/Disk), SSH logins, and Fail2Ban bans.
    -   Settings are saved in `config/alerts_config.json`.
-   **Repeat Resource Alerts:** The resource monitor now sends repeat notifications if the load remains high for longer than the set cooldown period (`RESOURCE_ALERT_COOLDOWN`).
-   **Branch Selection in `deploy.sh`:** The installation/update script now allows selecting the GitHub branch (`main` or `develop`) before downloading files.
-   **Service Status Editing:** The Alert system (`watchdog.py`) now edits a single message to display status changes: Unavailable üî¥ -> Activating üü° -> Active üü¢.

### ‚ú® Improved

-   **Button Navigation:**
    -   The "üîô Back to Menu" button now edits the message to "Returning to menu...", providing a smoother transition.
    -   "üîô Back" buttons in submenus use `edit_text` to navigate one step back within the same message.
    -   Added a "‚ùå Cancel" button for VLESS link generation.
-   **Alert System (`watchdog.py`):**
    -   Renamed to "Alert System" with a üö® emoji in messages.
    -   Improved service status detection (`activating`) using `systemctl status`.
    -   Standardized status texts.

## [1.10.7] - 2025-10-15

# üéâ First release: Telegram bot for managing your VPS!

Hello everyone!

I am pleased to present the first public release of a multifunctional Telegram bot for monitoring and administering your VPS/VDS server. This project was created to make server management as convenient, fast, and secure as possible, allowing key operations to be performed directly from the messenger.

The main feature of the project is not only the functional bot but also the powerful `deploy.sh` script, which makes installing, configuring, and maintaining the bot incredibly simple.
