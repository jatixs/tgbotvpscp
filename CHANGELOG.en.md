## [1.10.13] - 2025-10-26

### ‚ú® Improved:

* **Speedtest Localization:**
    * Results now display the country flag and city (instead of `Location`).
    * The `Server` field has been renamed to `Provider` for clarity.
* **Speedtest Server Lists:**
    * When the VPS geolocation is determined as Russia (`RU`), the bot will now attempt to use a list of Russian iperf3 servers from [GitHub](https://github.com/itdoginfo/russian-iperf3-servers) (in YAML format).
    * Added YAML file parsing for the Russian server list.
    * Added error handling for YAML list download/parsing with a fallback to the main JSON list.
    * The `deploy.sh`/`deploy_en.sh` scripts now install the `python3-yaml` system dependency.
* **Spam Protection:** Added a middleware handler (`core/middlewares.py`) that prevents overly frequent button presses (5-second cooldown).
* **Error Handling:** Improved exception handling in the `get_country_flag` function (`core/utils.py`) for more accurate detection and logging of network/API errors.
* **Logging:** Enhanced logging of unexpected errors using `logging.exception` to automatically include stack traces.
* **i18n Structure:** Keys within the translation dictionaries (`core/i18n.py`) have been sorted alphabetically for easier navigation.

### üîß Fixed:

* **Dependencies:** `PyYAML` added to `requirements.txt`. `python3-yaml` added to `deploy.sh`/`deploy_en.sh`.
* **Formatting:** Minor fixes to formatting and imports.

### üìù Documentation:

* **Adding a Module:** Added a section with instructions on how to create and integrate custom modules in `README.md` and `README.en.md`.
* Updated version and build numbers.

<details>
<summary><h2>üß© How to Add a Custom Module (Template):</h2></summary>

1.  **Create file:** `modules/my_module.py`
2.  **Write code:**
```
    # /opt/tg-bot/modules/my_module.py
    from aiogram import Dispatcher, types
    from aiogram.types import KeyboardButton
    from core.i18n import _, I18nFilter, get_user_lang
    from core import config
    from core.auth import is_allowed
    from core.messaging import delete_previous_message

    # 1. Unique key for the button in i18n
    BUTTON_KEY = "btn_my_command"

    # 2. Function to get the button
    def get_button() -> KeyboardButton:
        return KeyboardButton(text=_(BUTTON_KEY, config.DEFAULT_LANGUAGE))

    # 3. Function to register handlers
    def register_handlers(dp: Dispatcher):
        # Register handler for the button text (language aware)
        dp.message(I18nFilter(BUTTON_KEY))(my_command_handler)
        # Add other handlers (callback, state...) if needed

    # 4. Main command handler
    async def my_command_handler(message: types.Message):
        user_id = message.from_user.id
        chat_id = message.chat.id
        lang = get_user_lang(user_id)
        command_name_for_auth = "my_command" # Name for permission check

        # Check permissions
        if not is_allowed(user_id, command_name_for_auth):
            # await send_access_denied_message(message.bot, user_id, chat_id, command_name_for_auth)
            await message.reply(_("access_denied_generic", lang)) # Simple message
            return

        # Delete previous message from this command (if any)
        await delete_previous_message(user_id, command_name_for_auth, chat_id, message.bot)

        # --- Your logic here ---
        response_text = _("my_module_response", lang, data="some data")
        # ---

        # Send the response
        sent_message = await message.answer(response_text)
        # Optional: save message ID for future deletion
        # core.shared_state.LAST_MESSAGE_IDS.setdefault(user_id, {})[command_name_for_auth] = sent_message.message_id

    # Optional: background tasks
    # def start_background_tasks(bot: Bot) -> list[asyncio.Task]:
    #     task = asyncio.create_task(my_background_job(bot))
    #     return [task]
    # async def my_background_job(bot: Bot):
    #     while True: ... await asyncio.sleep(interval)
```
3.  **Add translations:** In `core/i18n.py`, add `"btn_my_command": "My Command"` to `'en'` and `"btn_my_command": "–ú–æ—è –ö–æ–º–∞–Ω–¥–∞"` to `'ru'`, as well as `"my_module_response": "Result: {data}"`, etc. Remember to run `sort_strings()` in `i18n.py` or sort manually.
4.  **Register module:** In `bot.py`, add `from modules import my_module` and `register_module(my_module)`.
5.  **Restart bot:** `sudo systemctl restart tg-bot`.

## [1.10.12] - 2025-10-22

### What's new?

#### üöÄ Added:

* **Multilingual Support (i18n):**
    * Added full support for **Russian and English languages** for all bot messages, buttons, menus, errors, and notifications.
    * Introduced a new `core/i18n.py` module to manage translations, including the `STRINGS` dictionary, functions for loading/saving settings (`load_user_settings`, `save_user_settings`), determining (`get_user_lang`) and setting (`set_user_lang`) user language, and the main translation function `get_text` (alias `_`).
    * Users can now select their language via the new "üá∑üá∫ –Ø–∑—ã–∫" / "üá¨üáß Language" button in the main menu, with settings saved in `config/user_settings.json`.
    * Added `I18nFilter` for Aiogram, allowing handlers to react to text commands regardless of language.
    * Added an inline keyboard for language selection (`get_language_keyboard`).
* **Documentation:** Added English versions `README.en.md` and `CHANGELOG.en.md` with switching links.
* **Deployment Script:** Added an English version of the deployment script `deploy_en.sh`.
* **Dependencies:** `iperf3` is now added as a dependency installed via `deploy.sh` / `deploy_en.sh`.

#### ‚ú® Improved:

* **Code Structure:** All user-facing strings have been externalized from module and core code into `core/i18n.py`.
* **`speedtest` Module:**
    * Completely rewritten to use `iperf3` instead of `speedtest-cli`.
    * Implemented finding the closest `iperf3` server by ping, prioritizing based on VPS country/continent.
    * Added message editing to display test status updates (locating, pinging, downloading, uploading).
    * Implemented multiple connection attempts to different servers in case of errors.
* **`traffic` Module:**
    * Added an inline "‚èπ Stop" button to the traffic monitoring message.
    * Pressing the main button again no longer stops monitoring; the inline button must be used.
* **Watchdog (`watchdog.py`):**
    * All error and status messages now use the i18n system (in the default language).
    * Improved handling of network errors (`requests.exceptions.RequestException`) and JSON decoding errors when sending/editing Telegram messages.
    * Improved logic for detecting `inactive`/`failed` status from `systemctl` errors.
    * Added distinct statuses/messages for planned restarts of the bot and the watchdog itself.
* **Logging:**
    * Implemented daily log rotation for `bot.py` and `watchdog.py` logs.
    * Bot and watchdog logs are now saved in separate subdirectories (`logs/bot/`, `logs/watchdog/`).
* **`users` Module:** When deleting a user, their language and notification settings are now also removed.
* **`xray` Module:** Adjusted Xray update commands for Amnezia (added `wget`/`unzip` installation) and Marzban (added check for `.env` file existence).
* **Utilities (`core/utils.py`):** `format_traffic` and `format_uptime` functions now support i18n for units (B, KB, y, d, etc.).
* **Keyboards (`core/keyboards.py`):** All button texts are now translated into the user's language.

#### üîß Fixed:

* **i18n:**
    * Fixed handling of non-integer `user_id` when setting language.
    * Added error handling for string formatting and checks for translation key existence in `get_text`.
* **`users` Module:** Fixed the use of string keys (`admins`/`users`) instead of localized names in `callback_data` when changing groups.
* **Circular Imports:** Resolved potential circular import issues between `core/shared_state.py` and `core/i18n.py`.
* **Imports:** Corrected relative imports (`from . import ...`) within the core package for proper functionality.
* **`selftest` Module:** Moved the import of `_` inside the handler function to avoid potential i18n initialization issues.

## [1.10.11] - 2025-10-21

### What's new?

#### üöÄ Added:
* **"‚ö°Ô∏è Optimize" Button:** Added a new module (`optimize.py`) to execute a set of system cleanup and optimization commands (root admins only).
* **Log Check by Watchdog:** `watchdog.py` now checks `bot.log` for errors (`ERROR`/`CRITICAL`) after the bot service starts.
* **Update Notifications:**
    * `watchdog.py` now periodically checks GitHub Releases and notifies about new versions.
    * `bot.py` now checks for updates on startup and notifies the administrator.
* **Version Display in `deploy.sh`:** The installation/update script now shows the locally installed and latest available versions from GitHub.
* **Bot Name in Watchdog:** `watchdog.py` now uses the bot name from the `TG_BOT_NAME` variable (if set in `.env`) in its notifications.

#### ‚ú® Improved:
* **Watchdog Status Logic:** Improved tracking and display of bot service statuses ("Unavailable" üî¥ -> "Starting" üü° -> "Active" üü¢ / "Active with errors" üü†).
* **Log Monitoring:** Reworked the `reliable_tail_log_monitor` function in `modules/notifications.py` for greater stability and elimination of `asyncio` errors.
* **`deploy.sh` Script:**
    * Improved detection of the target branch when run with an argument or via `bash <(wget ...)`.
    * Added clearer information about branches and versions in the menu.
* Minor changes in code formatting and message texts.

#### üîß Fixed:
* **`AssertionError: feed_data after feed_eof` Error:** Resolved an `asyncio` race condition error when reading logs (`tail -f`) in `modules/notifications.py`.
* **`NameError: name 're' is not defined` Error:** Added the missing `import re` in the `modules/optimize.py` module.
* **`unexpected EOF while looking for matching }'` Error:** Fixed bash syntax (missing parenthesis) in the `run_with_spinner` function in `deploy.sh`.
* **User Saving Error:** Corrected the user loading logic in `core/auth.py` so that added users are correctly saved to `users.json`.
* **New User Name Display:** New users are now immediately displayed with the name obtained from the Telegram API, rather than the temporary "New\_ID".

## [1.10.10] - 2025-10-20

### üí• Breaking Changes

-   **Complete Modularization:** The bot's code (`bot.py`) has been completely reorganized. Logic is divided into the core (`core/`) and function modules (`modules/`). The old structure is no longer supported.
-   **Reworked `deploy.sh`:** The installation/update script (`deploy.sh`) now uses `git clone` / `git reset` for file management and includes an installation integrity check. The old installation method via `curl` has been removed. **A clean (re)installation using the new `deploy.sh` is required.**

### üöÄ Added

-   **Integrity Check in `deploy.sh`:** The `deploy.sh` script now automatically checks for the presence of all necessary files (`core/`, `modules/`, `.git`, `venv/`, `.env`, `systemd` services) before displaying the menu.
-   **"Smart" Routing in `deploy.sh`:** Depending on the integrity check result (OK, PARTIAL, NOT_FOUND), `deploy.sh` directs the user to the appropriate menu (Installation, Management, or Error Message/Reinstallation suggestion).
-   **Automatic `.gitignore` Creation:** The `deploy.sh` script now creates a `.gitignore` file to protect user files (`.env`, `config/`, `logs/`, `venv/`) from being overwritten during updates via `git`.

### ‚ú® Improved

-   **Project Structure:** The new modular architecture (`core/`, `modules/`) significantly improves code readability, simplifies maintenance, and makes adding new features easier.
-   **Installation/Update Reliability:** Using `git` in `deploy.sh` instead of `curl` ensures all current project files are obtained and simplifies the update process.
-   **Menu Button Grouping:** Buttons in the main `ReplyKeyboard` menu are now grouped into logical categories for better navigation (although submenus were removed in favor of a single menu).

### üîß Fixed

-   **User ID Error in "Back to Menu" Callback:** Fixed an issue where pressing the inline "Back to Menu" button used the bot's ID instead of the user's ID, resulting in access denial.
-   **`NameError: name 'KeyboardButton' is not defined` Error:** Resolved a missing import of `KeyboardButton` in `bot.py`.
-   **`systemd` Service Parsing Error:** Corrected incorrect formatting of the `[Service]` section in `.service` files created by `deploy.sh` (all directives were on one line).

---

<p align="center">
  <i>Version 1.10.10 (Build 36) ‚Äî Major refactoring to improve structure, stability, and deployment process.</i>
</p>

---

## [1.10.9] - 2025-10-19

### üîß Fixed (Hotfixes)

-   **Freezing on Shutdown/Restart:** Completely resolved the issue where the bot would hang for 90 seconds (`SIGTERM timeout`) when stopping the service. Implemented correct signal handling (`SIGINT`/`SIGTERM`) and shutdown sequence: stop polling, cancel background tasks (including `tail`) with timeouts, close session. Fixed `RuntimeError: Event loop is closed` and `AttributeError` during session closure.
-   **False Alert System Trigger:** The Alert system (`watchdog.py`) now correctly ignores planned restarts initiated by the bot (checks `restart_flag.txt`).
-   **Duplicate Resource Alerts:** Resource checking has been completely removed from the Alert system (`watchdog.py`) and is now performed only by the bot (`bot.py`), respecting user settings.

### üöÄ Added

-   **Log Monitoring:** The bot now monitors SSH login events (`auth.log`/`secure`) and Fail2Ban bans (`fail2ban.log`) in the background using `tail -f`.
-   **Notification Settings:**
    -   Added a "üîî Notifications" menu allowing users to enable/disable alerts for resources (CPU/RAM/Disk), SSH logins, and Fail2Ban bans.
    -   Settings are saved in `config/alerts_config.json`.
-   **Repeat Resource Alerts:** The resource monitor now sends repeat notifications if the load remains high for longer than the set cooldown period (`RESOURCE_ALERT_COOLDOWN`).
-   **Branch Selection in `deploy.sh`:** The installation/update script now allows selecting the GitHub branch (`main` or `develop`) before downloading files.
-   **Service Status Editing:** The Alert system (`watchdog.py`) now edits a single message to display status changes: Unavailable üî¥ -> Activating üü° -> Active üü¢.

### ‚ú® Improved

-   **Button Navigation:**
    -   The "üîô Back to Menu" button now edits the message to "Returning to menu...", providing a smoother transition.
    -   "üîô Back" buttons in submenus use `edit_text` to navigate one step back within the same message.
    -   Added a "‚ùå Cancel" button for VLESS link generation.
-   **Alert System (`watchdog.py`):**
    -   Renamed to "Alert System" with a üö® emoji in messages.
    -   Improved service status detection (`activating`) using `systemctl status`.
    -   Standardized status texts.
